#### Effect of the P, I, D component of the PID algorithm

The P component produces an output that is propotional to the current error, CTE.
It is derived by multiplying the error by a constant Kp, the proportional gain.
the steering angle should be propotional to CTE, it makes a sharper turn when CTE is larger.
We calculate the P component by multipling the proportional gain Kp with CTE divided by current car speed (Kp*(CTE/speed)). However, the CTE can be reduced to zero quickly with a large Kp value, but it also results in oscillation in the track.
The I component is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have been corrected previously.
This term should accelerates the movement of the car to intended trajectory and eliminates the residual steady-state error.
We calculate this term by summing all CTE and multiply it with a constant Ki.

The D is proportional to the rate of change of CTE.
This component can compensate for a changing CTE, thus inhibit more rapid changes of CTE due to promotional term.

####  how the final hyperparameters (P, I, D coefficients) was choosen

Manually tuned the paprameters, with hit and trial for each,

the final parameter was 0.3,0.0,1 for Kp , Ki and Kd

#### future

to try with twiddle for avoiding the shaking and smooth control.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
